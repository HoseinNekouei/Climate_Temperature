# Temperature Forecasting using GRU Model

This repository contains code for building a temperature forecasting model using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network. The model is designed to predict future temperature values based on historical temperature data.

## Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes functions to preprocess the input features and label data for training the GRU model.
2. **Model Building**: Defines the architecture of the GRU model for temperature forecasting.
3. **Training**: Trains the GRU model on the preprocessed data and saves the trained model.
4. **Evaluation**: This function evaluates the performance of the trained model on test data and displays relevant metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Includes code for visualizing the predicted temperature values against the actual values.

## Usage

To use this repository for temperature forecasting:
1. Prepare your temperature dataset in the required format.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided functions in the `preprocessing_data`
3. Build and train the GRU model using the provided function in the 'algorithm'
4. Evaluate the model performance using the `MAE.`


Feel free to customize the model architecture and training parameters based on your dataset and forecasting requirements.
